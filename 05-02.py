# name = {"Pune", "mumbai", "Delhi","1","1"}
# print(name)

# Difference between = and ==

a = 5  # assign a value to variable, Just assign right operand to left operands
b=5

print(a == b)  # comparing the operands or checks the two values are equal or not.

# ** in python.

print(5**3)  # fpr squaring or cubiing (means mutiplication of that number how much value we have enter)


a=11 # Binary code 1011

b=5 #  Binary code 101  , then put 0 in start I.e 0101 for 3 digits

print (a ^ b) # 14

c = 18 #  10010

d = 10  # 01010

print (c ^ d)
